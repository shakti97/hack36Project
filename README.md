# Flashify
## The Accessible Learning App
Hackathon Project for Hack36 happened at MNNIT, Allahabad , India

The app is WIP and is a flash card app for undergrduate and school students

THe app can be completely controlled by voice and is accessible for blind people as well.

# Problem 
Flashify was made to make the process of learning more interesting , easy , quick and most important of all accessible.
Flashify works on the principal of active recall. Active Recall is one of the best methods to learn and rank higher than most orthodox learning methods like re-reading and making notes.Also blind people are not able to make use of such brilliant learning techniques and Flashify solves this problem too.
Overall flashify is a complete solution to everyone's learning need.

## How the problem is Solved
Making an app for blind people is always difficult, we used browser's inbuilt SpeechUtterance API for text to speech and react-recognition for speech to text
The apis that we have used in this application are very new and that is why not very stable,some redundancy is always present in such apps.
Due to lack of fast internet connection we had to use these newer API's other than google TTS api's.This app can be later changed to utlize faster and more stable google cloud API's
The application is built using React on the frontend and Node.js (Express) at the backend and is pretty fast and reusable.
